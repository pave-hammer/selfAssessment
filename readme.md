#Self Assessment - Block 1

1. **What areas do you feel you are struggling the most in? (Be specific, technologies, habits, etc.)**
I feel as if I am most struggling with learn and getting things done there. I need to better manage my time so I can work on the projects that are on the more complex side while still hitting the milestones the course needs me to.


2. **Develop a plan using S.M.A.R.T. goals to continue progress in the areas you mentioned above.** *S.M.A.R.T. - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely.*
A good way to address this is the set a specific amount of time aside, maybe an hour or so, to dedicate to specifically doing modules on learn, with the intention to complete the units and get feedback.


3. **Look back at Block 1, choose 3 'aha' moments where something clicked and describe them below.**
‘Aha’ moment one: bootstrap (thanks Tony). ‘Aha’ moment two: DOM manipulation and research. ‘Aha’ moment three: getting POST request to work.


4. **What areas do you feel the most confident in? What is making you happy right now?**
I’m not sure there is any one specific thing I can say I’m most confident in. I enjoy getting a project with basic concepts of what needs to be done and working through the task with the goal to create a finished product. I am most happy with the process of being productive and getting things done.


5. **What technologies/industries are you most excited about currently?**
I am most excited about the gaming industry. There is new tech coming out all the time with a specified purpose to make gaming and other various forms of entertainment better looking, better performing, more creative and with more content. As tech advances, so does the entertainment. RTX technology from Nvidia, as an example, is a whole new concept looking into how graphics are processed and the results could improve many aspects of human society.
